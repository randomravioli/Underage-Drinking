    <p> This must stop. We as a community must do something to help stop this.<br> Whether its schools educating kids about alcohol at an early age. Or making any<br> of our friends understand the problems and disadvantages of drinking. In most<br> countries around the world the drinking age is usually about 18 to 19 years old,<br> but did you know New Zealand does not have any legal drinking age? In this<br> country you can drink at whatever age you want but, you must have your<br> parents verbal confirmation. Most teenagers who have been recently been<br> introduced to alcohol, do not have their parent's approval and usually do not<br> plan to tell their parents. This presents many difficulties, since the parent<br> doesnâ€™t know that their child has been drinking, it may be too late to stop this<br> before it becomes a serious problem. This is another great reason why kids<br> should be educated about alcohol and the effects of it before they come to<br> the age of wanting to try it themselves. Italy holds the title of having the lowest<br><img src="images/sunset-cheers.jpg" width="350px" alt="beer-bottles-cheering-with-sun-behind-them" id="cheers"> drinking age in the world, 16, yet in Italy, the number of minors who binge drink<br> and abuse alcohol is much less. The reason being that over there kids<br> have been much more effectively been taught about alcohol and it is socially<br> acceptable to drink alcohol if you are with your parents.</p> 
    

       <p>In conclusion, underage drinking is a problem that we need to stop. People<br> should know of the idea of why teens give in to alcohol. Knowing this we,<br> cannot only educate kids but also know why teenagers do this. We should <br>learn the affects and downsides of drinking and realize why people tell us<br> about all this. Last, but not least we, as a community, and by ourselves should<br> support stopping this unnecessary act. </p>
