   <p>Did you know that in New Zealand it is approximated about 57%<br> of 15-17-year old's drink? Or that some teenagers are drinking as much as<br>  two boxes of alcohol on one occasion? Teenage drinking<br> is rising at an alarmingly high rate, causing many teens to grow up<br>with a hazardous drinking problem. So why do teens drink? How<br> does it affect them? And how should we individually and as a<br> community help stop this? </p>
        
   <p>Why do teenagers drink? Is it to act cool? To show off? Or is it<br> the environment they’ve grown up in? One of the main reasons of<br>underage drinking, is the influence of other people around them.<br><img src="images/normal-cheers.jpg" width="300px" alt="Two beer bottles" id="twobeerbottles"> Most of this includes growing up in a household where drinking<br> may be a usual or obvious activity, such witnessing their parents<br> come home every night and drink a bottle of beer. Something as<br> simple as that can later in life cause a big problem. Another<br> influence may be seeing their friends drink and wanting to<br> participate in the act being ‘cool’ or ‘fitting in’. Another main<br> reason why some teenagers may want to drink is stress, anxiety or<br> depression. As it is known our teen years are quite busy and<br> stressful years in our life, not only is our body changing but our<br> personalities, likes, dislikes, our perception of viewing different<br> things, takes a toll on many kids, and then if you include school,<br> everything is one giant headache. This is a reason why many<br> teens turn to drugs and alcohol for an unhealthy outlet of all these<br> problems.  </p>
        
 <p>How does it affect us? A young person’s body is more vulnerable to alcohol than an adult. The reason<br> being that in our teenage years our brains are still developing, drinking during this critical growth period<br> can cause lifelong brain damages, like irreversible memory loss and wet brain. When someone gets drunk<br> the alcohol in their body causes nerve cells, in their brain to slow down, this is what causes staggering,<br> slurred speech, blurry vision and a lack of motor skills. A lack of motor skills can be<br> extremely dangerous, the reason being that, it affects your coordination, speed, accuracy and responsive<br> time. All of these being affected is extremely dangerous. Some of these are what causes death<br> from drunk driving. Due to puberty, teenagers have a natural tendency to take risks and experiment while<br> being drunk. Doing this can put them in a dangerous or vulnerable position. Therefore, teenagers are<br> more likely to do something illegal or be more aggressive to others than grown up drinkers.</p>
